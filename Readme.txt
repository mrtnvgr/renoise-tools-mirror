DESCRIPTION OF SAMRENDER:

SamRender is one of the best sample rendering tools for Renoise. Select any part of your song and quickly convert it to a sample. Ideal for converting tracks and entire groups or pieces of them or patterns into samples within the same instrument or in several instruments.
