# MidiConvert

## Description

Converts a Renoise song into a MIDI file. Notes are grouped by instrument and exported per track.

The tool creates a menu entry called "Export Song to MIDI..." in the File menu, "Selection:Export to MIDI..." in the Pattern Editor menu, and an "Export Selection to MIDI" keybinding.

## Contributing

The code is decently commented, includes a generic Midi.lua class that can be reused for other tasks. Patches are welcome.
