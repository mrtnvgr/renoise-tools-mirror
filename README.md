# SliceMate 

This tool makes it easy to slice auto-seeked samples and phrases from within the pattern editor. Perfect for remixing and working with rendered stems. 

## Features

* Easily slice samples and phrases from within the pattern editor
* Visualize the sample position in the waveform editor as you are navigating the song
* Able to determine the position in a sample, even when tuned/transposed 
* Supports real-time operation (slice a sample while listening to it) with optional quantization
* Can "slice" phrases too - also when using a different LPB than the song
* "Delay-column-aware", for maximum precision 

## Quickstart

Download the tool from the Renoise tool page, and double-click or drag the xrnx file on top of the Renoise window to install.

The tool can be launched in a number of ways:

* From the Renoise Tools menu > SliceMate
* From the supplied MIDI and keyboard shortcuts (search for 'SliceMate')

### How to slice a sample

1. Load up some (long) sample and enter it into the pattern
2. Position the cursor somewhere in the 'note trail' 
3. Check the SliceMate status panel - tells us if the sample is valid
4. If the sample is invalid, a warning appears (click for solution)
5. Else, we are able to slice the sample. Hit **"Slice at Cursor"**
6. If sample settings are compatible, a new slice/note is inserted
7. Move cursor somewhere else, repeat and rinse 

### How to slice a phrase

1. Load an instrument which contains one or more phrases
2. Enter a note somewhere in the pattern. 
3. Enter a Zxx command for the note, or ensure that "Prg" mode is enabled
4. Position the cursor somewhere in the 'note trail' 
5. If we are unable to slice, a warning appears (click for solution). 
6. Else, we are able to slice the sample. Hit **"Slice at Cursor"**
7. If sample settings are compatible, a new note is inserted
8. Move cursor somewhere else, repeat and rinse 


## The user interface 

The user interface is organized into a number of panels:

### Status panel

The topmost part is displaying the current status

* Instrument name: show the name of the detected instrument (if any)
* Warning triangle: shown if the tool has detected any problems.
* Detach: click this button to detach the instrument editor 

Below, some more detailed information:

#### For samples

* "Slice": shows you which slice is currently selected
* "Pos": shows you the frame (position in sample) of the slice and/or root sample

#### For phrases

* "Phrase": shows you which phrase has been detected
* "Sxx" : shows you the "internal" line + delay of the phrase at this position

### Navigation panel

* Left/right arrows: allows you to navigate between columns and tracks
* Previous/next buttons: detect and move cursor to other notes/lines in the song 

### Options panel 

This panel contains all options for SliceMate

#### Slice Options

* Insert note: inserts a note in the pattern every time the sample is sliced
* Quantize note: make sure notes are always on a line [1]
* Propagate VOL/PAN: when inserting a note, use the volume and panning from the previous one

> [1]: You can record non-quantized ("precise") sliced notes by disabling this feature. Do the slicing while playing, with the pattern-editor cursor set to follow playback.

#### Selection 

These options deal with selections, as the cursor position changes:

* Auto-select instrument 
* Auto-select in sample list
* Auto-select in waveform  

> Note: if *any* if these options are enabled, the tool will track pattern contains as you navigate around the song (this is the default choice). 

#### General

* "Auto-start tool": will launch the tool when Renoise starts/on a new song


## Limitations

The tool can only work with samples that are configured like this

* Auto-seek: ON, Beat-sync: OFF 
* No pitch modulation (not allowed when auto-seeked)

The tool will tell you if any of the above conditions are not met. 

Also, the tool is not able to reliably track the position if you are 

* Using commands to modify the song tempo (BPM and LPB)
* Using commands sample playback (e.g. 0Bxx/reverse)

Finally, the tool does not support slicing looped samples. 
You can use the tool with such samples, but once the playback reaches the loop end-point, slicing is no longer possible (you should receive an error message if you try).
