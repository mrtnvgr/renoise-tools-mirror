--[ @@Manual@@ ]--------------------------------------------------------------------

This small tool adds a few menu entries to the mixer and allows you to show all
automated, modulated and midi mapped sliders and also to hide them all. This can
be applied to the complete mixer or just single tracks.

With modulated sliders the ones automated by the Meta Devices from Renoise are
meant, which also takes crosstrack routing into account.

Switch to the mixer view in Renoise, open the context menu and look for
"Mixer ->" and "Track ->" to find the new menu entries.

Keybinds can be found in the Renoise preferences under "Mixer -> Mixer ->" and
"Mixer -> Track ->".

If you have found a bug or otherwise need help with this tool, then feel free to
mail me at the address given above.
