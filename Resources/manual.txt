This tool makes it easy to copy and paste automation data for the complete song
between different device parameters.

To access this tool, open the automation editor and do a right click on one of
the automated parameters in the list. Once copied find your target parameter
and do a right click again for pasting the data.

You can copy the automation envelopes or pattern command automation or both at
once. Pasting works for all types the same, but pasting pattern commands can be
done with a conversion to an envelope too. The tool also takes care to convert
pattern command automation for panning, volume and width to their proper effect
commands. In a rare case that the effect columns contain multiple pattern
commands for the same parameter, only the last found one will be copied.

In some cases pasting pattern command automation may be disabled. This can
happen when you have no empty effect column left in the target channel or when
the target parameter is out of bounds, which is limited by the internal pattern
command resolution. The status bar will give you a notice then.

The aim of writing this small tool is to make replacing already automated
devices easier by having a quick way to copy and paste their automation data.

If you have found a bug or otherwise need help with this tool, then feel free to
