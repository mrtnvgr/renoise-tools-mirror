This page asks you to specify a name for your data. The name has to be unique (not already in use) and a valid Lua identifier (normal latin characters, and not beginning with a number). You can choose a type too, such as `number` or `string`. 

When you press 'Done', a small code template is generated, according to the type of value you chose. Note that you can change this type at any time - the template is only meant as a starting point.
