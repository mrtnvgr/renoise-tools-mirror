A simple transient method to attempt to detect BPM rates in samples.
You can use four default detection profiles to assist you in detecting the proper 
BPM rate of your sample loop. 

If all else fails, you can manually count the highest transients (bass and snare drums) 
and manually set the "Beats in Sample", click the check box and let it calculate the BPM rate for 
the time-span your sample runs. 

Feel free to improve/adjust the routine to your needs.
