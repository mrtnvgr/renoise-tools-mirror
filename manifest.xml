  <Description>SamRender is one of the best sample rendering tools for Renoise. Select any part of your song and quickly convert it to a sample. Ideal for converting tracks and entire groups or pieces of them or patterns into samples within the same instrument or in several instruments.

Use SamRender as a &quot;bridge tool&quot; between Renoise and other DAWs to transfer waves. Or use SamRender to convert the entire song into a sample and study the resulting sound wave.</Description>
