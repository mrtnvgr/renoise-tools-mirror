  <Description>This script overrides the looping feature of the pattern matrix. It will clone the loop sequence in the pattern matrix when a pattern in the loop is played and edit mode is on. The edit cursor must be set to follow the playback position. It&apos;s useful to jam over a sequence. Just select the loop you want to record on, and your whole performance will be recorded. The tool can be enabled or disabled via the Tools menu or via keybinding.</Description>
